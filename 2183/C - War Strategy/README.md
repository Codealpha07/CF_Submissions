You, as the country's top general, must strategize where to place your troops.</p><p>There are $$$n$$$ bases in a line, with the $$$k$$$-th of which being the home base for your army. Initially, there is only a single soldier at base $$$k$$$. Each day, the following happens in order:</p><ul> <li> You give out an order by choosing a base $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \leq i \leq n$$$), and <span class="tex-font-style-bf">any</span> number of soldiers inside that base (which is allowed to be $$$0$$$ or all soldiers in that base currently). Then, tell all soldiers you ordered to either move to base $$$i-1$$$ or base $$$i+1$$$. All soldiers must move in the same direction, and no soldier is allowed to move to the left of base $$$1$$$ or to the right of base $$$n$$$. </li><li> Then, a new soldier moves onto base $$$k$$$. This soldier cannot be ordered by that day's commands. </li></ul> <p>However, time is tight, and there are only $$$m$$$ days until the enemy attacks. A base is called <span class="tex-font-style-it">fortified</span> if at least one soldier resides in it. Your job is to find the maximum number of fortified bases (including the home base) you can have by the end of the $$$m$$$-th day.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><div class="section-title">Input</div><p>Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. </p><p>The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^5$$$, $$$1 \leq m \leq 10^9$$$) — denoting the number of bases, the number of days you have to fortify your bases, and the index of the home base.</p><p>It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2\cdot 10^5$$$. </p></div><div class="output-specification"><div class="section-title">Output</div><p>For each test case, print the maximum number of bases you can fortify at the end of the $$$m$$$-th day.</p></div><div class="sample-tests"><div class="section-title">Example</div><div class="sample-test"><div class="input"><div class="title">Input<div title="Copy" data-clipboard-target="#id003634002723372919" id="id0036206559227868607" class="input-output-copier">Copy</div></div><pre id="id003634002723372919"><div class="test-example-line test-example-line-even test-example-line-0">7</div><div class="test-example-line test-example-line-odd test-example-line-1">3 1 3</div><div class="test-example-line test-example-line-even test-example-line-2">3 3 2</div><div class="test-example-line test-example-line-odd test-example-line-3">4 2 2</div><div class="test-example-line test-example-line-even test-example-line-4">3 2 1</div><div class="test-example-line test-example-line-odd test-example-line-5">4 3 3</div><div class="test-example-line test-example-line-even test-example-line-6">7 7 4</div><div class="test-example-line test-example-line-odd test-example-line-7">100000 1000000000 100000</div></pre></div><div class="output"><div class="title">Output<div title="Copy" data-clipboard-target="#id005311024814178447" id="id004505712576770937" class="input-output-copier">Copy</div></div><pre id="id005311024814178447"><div class="test-example-line test-example-line-odd test-example-line-1">2</div><div class="test-example-line test-example-line-even test-example-line-2">3</div><div class="test-example-line test-example-line-odd test-example-line-3">3</div><div class="test-example-line test-example-line-even test-example-line-4">2</div><div class="test-example-line test-example-line-odd test-example-line-5">3</div><div class="test-example-line test-example-line-even test-example-line-6">6</div><div class="test-example-line test-example-line-odd test-example-line-7">100000</div></pre></div></div></div><div class="note"><div class="section-title">Note</div><p>In the second test case, here is one way to fortify $$$3$$$ bases:</p><ul> <li> On the first day, order $$$0$$$ soldiers in base $$$3$$$ to move to base $$$2$$$. At the end of the day, a new soldier moves to base $$$2$$$ (there are now $$$2$$$ soldiers in base $$$2$$$ and $$$0$$$ soldiers on any other base). </li><li> On the second day, order $$$1$$$ soldier in base $$$2$$$ to move to base $$$1$$$. At the end of the day, a new soldier moves to base $$$2$$$. There are now $$$2$$$ soldiers in base $$$2$$$ and $$$1$$$ soldier on base $$$1$$$. </li><li> On the third day, order $$$2$$$ soldiers in base $$$2$$$ to move to base $$$3$$$. At the end of the day, a new soldier moves to base $$$2$$$. There are now $$$1$$$ soldier in base $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, and $$$2$$$ soldiers in base $$$3$$$. </li><li> There is now at least one soldier in each of bases $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, $$$3$$$. Therefore, the answer is $$$3$$$. </li></ul><p>In the third test case, here is one way you can achieve $$$3$$$ bases being fortified:</p><ul> <li> On the first day, order the existing soldier to move from base $$$2$$$ to base $$$3$$$. At the end of the day, a new soldier moves to base $$$2$$$. </li><li> On the second day, order the soldier in base $$$2$$$ to move to base $$$1$$$. At the end of the day, a new soldier moves to base $$$2$$$. </li><li> There is now a soldier at each of bases $$$1,2,3$$$. Therefore, the answer is $$$3$$$. It can be shown we cannot have more than $$$3$$$ fortified bases by the end of day $$$2$$$. </li></ul><p>Below is a vivid explanation of the third test case.</p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="https://espresso.codeforces.com/f0741da95a7d89fcb2247ee93848c6fbbb917105.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;">   </center></div>
